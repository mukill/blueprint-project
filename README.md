This is a simple blog app created using Rails

You can run this server using the ```command bin/rails``` server from the base repo. You can then simply navigate to localhost:3000 to see the main page of the app.

If this is your first time running this application, you will have to run a db migration using ```bin/rails db:migrate```

Currently the username and password are hardcoded in as user: dhh, pass:secret

Here is a screenshot of the application running:
